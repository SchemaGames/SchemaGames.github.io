    <h3>Roots</h3>
    <p>Schema Games began as a small gaming and modding outfit. Over the years, we got better and better at making games. Now, we even make games that you can play! Eventually, we might make games that are worth throwing money at, but for now, all of our games are free.</p>

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>We aim to make games and make them well. Here's how we go about it.
        <ul class="schemalist">
            <li>From all reports, crunch-time is bad. Hey, even long workweeks, or even workdays aren't always comfortable. Plus, in our connected and somewhat globalized world, people live in wildly different timezones. So we don't keep schedules. We work when we want to, and on what we want to.</li>
            <li>We all own anything we make on an individual basis, and can open-source it or keep it to ourselves to whatever extent we find reasonable.</li>
            <li>Education is important, and possibly the core of education is just trying lots of stuff and learning from that. So we put aside plenty of time for experimentation and side-projects, even if they won't yield anything tangible.</li>
            <li>Getting stuff done is also important - and to get stuff done you need solid tools. Tools that are self-molded to supplement a developer's specific needs or wants are ideal. We also craft small modular tools to augment our pipelines, and keep up to date on the best practices out there.</li>
            <li>True to the "indie" spirit, we like making quirky games and jam games and games that maybe don't quite work right but are still hopefully interesting on some level. Don't expect huge AAA 3d hyper-realistic fare.</li>
        </ul>
    If these things make sense to you, maybe you'll enjoy our games. Or at least enjoy how we make them, since the games themselves are not quite the sum of their parts.
