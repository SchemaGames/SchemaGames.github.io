One day, a lonely soul came upon a planet teeming with life. The landscape
varied from lush green forests, to dry barren deserts. With great curiosity,
the soul began to inhabit the world ruled by humans.
<br/>
At first, the soul found comfort with the beings that ruled the land. But to
the soul's dismay, the very same beings brought many forms of destruction to
all things, including themselves.
<br/>
The lonely soul went to a friend seeking answers.
<br/>
"How can this be? Knowing the wonders of life, these beings still insist on
destroying one another for the most trivial of things. To think that evil
presists even here in this land... I may end up hating these creatures."
<br/>
"Don't forget, hatred by itself can bring about the evil you so hate. Maybe it
is true that these creatures are flawed in their ways, but surely there is some
good, some value, to be found in them. Maybe, even their society could prevail
where ours could not."
<br/>
Still distressed, the lonely soul wandered and ended up on the shore, waves of
cold gray waters sifting the sand every which way. The sun was absent, leaving
the moon reflecting pale light off the ocean's horizon. And the stars shined on,
a canvas of speckled white dots glittering in the distance.
<br/>
"Maybe if everyone could take a moment to see nature as it is..."
<br/>
With a stroke, the soul began painting a picture. And many more afterwards.
<br/>
It is said that at the shore on a moonlit night, vivid dreams could be seen by
those who wander by the cascading waves, and the sifting sands by the sea.
