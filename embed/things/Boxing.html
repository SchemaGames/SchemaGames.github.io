"Look, I don't know if ya know what it's like to fight for somethin' with every fiber of ya being, and lose, but that's what I done. You haven't had to fight yet. Mebe tomorrow, mebe ten years down the road, you will. And when that time comes, ya'll still probably win. That's who ya are. But never, never forget that every time ya win a fight, somebody else loses it."

The man was holding onto the rope at the side of the ring as if he were hanging onto it for dear life, but that was just his way.

"Look, there was once this English professor. He worked at a bigtime university, had tenure, the works. One day, he is talking to his class about positives and negatives, and was telling them all about how languages treat em differently. He says, 'Well, take English... you get a double-negative and it turns out to mean a positive, like someone saying "Not nothing," when they really mean that there's something. But take something like Spanish, or Russian, and a double-negative just means an even stronger negative.' They call that, oh what was it, a negative concord. Something like that. So the professor goes on with 'Interestingly, there are no languages that possess a double positive which means a negative.' At this point, a kid in the back shouts, 'Yeah, right!'"

"I did not understand a single word of that."

"It's a joke. 'S funny."

"Oh. Well, work on the delivery."

"But there's also a point to it all. Ya see, whenever you're told ya can't do something, ya can't have something, whoever is telling ya that is only talking about most cases. Them's the breaks. Don't forget though, that there are always, always exceptions to the rule. If someone can tell ya all about the thing you can't do, then that action exists. And ya can do it, if ya know how. The hard part's the knowing."

"I dunno."

"What's not to know? Ya think I got to be my age by not knowing things?"

"No, just, the first thing you said and the second thing. Why does someone always have to lose a fight if I win it, if there are always exceptions to every rule? Seems like a contradiction."

"Not really. There are exceptions to the rule that there must always be exceptions. Ya see, it all works out nicely."

"Nah, it's all, just, paradoxical is all. If there aren't always exceptions, then how are there always exceptions?"

"Shut up."

"Whatever. Found any matches for me yet?"

The double doors to the gym were thrown open.

"Yo, there's an fight outside."

"Well, that's it then. Ya're done for today. Let's take a look."
