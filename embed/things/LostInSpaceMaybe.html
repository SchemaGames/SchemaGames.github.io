_Wouldn't it be nice to just be lost in space?_
<br/><br/>
In my travels I met a boy who always rode his bike every morning to the edge of the dome. Always there as the daily freighter ship docked with the station, eyes sparkling with excitement. I came to know that his parents were of a typical dysfunctional family; always arguing, threatening, fighting. Thankfully, they showered only kindness on the boy, but he still bore scars. Internal ones.
<br/>
One time, while I was taking a break from unloading parts at a local bar, the boy was walking with his bike to the edge of the dome again. (I was seated outside the joint, all by my lonesome at a table on edge.) I asked him, "What do you see when the ships come in?" He only shrugged and walked on, but I saw some determination in his eyes.
<br/>
I asked him again another time while we passed each other by on the street. (I was delivering spare parts across town that time.) He paused, looked up at me with lost eyes this time and said, "Wouldn't it be nice to just be lost in space?"
<br/><br/>
It was only hours later when I realized what he was planning. I radioed to the chief my concerns, and he replied that they caught a stowaway hiding in the cargo hold of one of their ships. It was the boy.
<br/>
I personally escorted the boy back to his home, which required some help of the local townsfolk for directions. It was apparent his parents already heard of what had happened, and embraced him with tears and such. I told them my concerns, that for someone to try to go on an adventure like thatâ€¦ means they feel caged in where they are now. Maybe do something about their struggles. I was always bad with spoken words.
<br/>
With that I walked off back to work; nothing much to see here.
